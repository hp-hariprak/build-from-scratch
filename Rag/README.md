# Rag
# RAG Experiments Project

This project focuses on experiments with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).  
It is meant for learning, testing, and prototyping ideas around document retrieval and context-based generation.

## What’s Inside

- Code for document retrieval
- Experiments with embeddings and search
- Scripts that combine retrieved context with language models

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Read the requirements file.
3. Install the needed dependencies.
4. Run the scripts and experiment with the pipeline.

## Goal

Keep the code simple, clear, and easy to modify for new experiments.
